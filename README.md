# TerraFly Airlines

## Description

This C++ project aims to create a Flight Reservation System that allows users to search for available flights, view seat availability, and make reservations. The system models airports as nodes in a graph, where each airport is represented as an object with its name and connections to other airports. Users can search for flights based on various criteria and reserve seats on desired flights. The project incorporates concepts such as data structures, database management, user interfaces, and more to provide a comprehensive flight booking experience. It's a challenging yet rewarding project that showcases C++ programming skills and algorithmic thinking.
